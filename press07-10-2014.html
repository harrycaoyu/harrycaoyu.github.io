	<p align="left">TORONTO, ON -- Oct 8, 2014 -- Brizi announces its runway event partnership with Startup Fashion Week to facilitate live coverage and aerial sponsorship. Brizi's social-drone will be flying at the Future of Fashion Showcase on Thursday October 9, 2014 and the Closing Party throughout the 3-day series of events.
	<br><br>"This was a perfect opportunity for Brizi to showcase our social tools for connected devices right here in Canada, though international interest has been huge for us” said Anna Hu, CEO and Co-Founder of Brizi. "We're establishing ourselves as the social layer for the Internet of Things, and this event partnership allows us to fly the latest iteration of the Brizi drone and further measure the viral impact of our aerial photo & social engagement tools.”
	<br><br>Event attendees will be able to use their mobile phones to access Brizi's aerial photo capturing, video streaming, and sharing tools at the event, without having to download an app. The broadcast will also be available for second-screen interactions, with audiences tuning into the event online, through Startup Fashion Week’s branded portal on the Brizi platform. These digital viewers have the opportunity to access the Brizi drone while not physically present at the event. All content captured will have sponsor branding watermarked prior to social sharing.
	<br><br>"We see Brizi as a game changer for our Runway Show event," Said Jodi Goodfellow, Executive Producer of Startup Fashion Week. "I am always looking for unique and purposeful ways to incorporate technology into the experience to drive audience engagement.  As an Event Producer, it is also important to find creative platforms to grow sponsorship revenue and increase digital impressions, which is exactly what Brizi does! With their ability to broadcast the video feed of the event in real-time and the custom branding on all social engagements, this partnership is a big win for me.”
	<br><br>"We are democratizing the broadcasting switch!" remarked Sami Dalati with excitement, Head of Technology and Co-Founder of Brizi. "We empower any connected device to capture and share multimedia in real-time while giving control of the content to the audience.” Dalati’s approach to development is always putting the user first. “Live events like SFW provide opportunities for our hardware and software teams to further understand how users engage and the associated impact on the brand and event sponsors. It helps us prioritize social, engagement and control mechanisms for our product roadmap.”
	<br><br>Brizi’s technology has been put in action across North America and Europe at dozens of events. Developer access to the platform will be available in 2015. </p>

	<h3><a href="http://startupfashionweek.com">About Startup Fashion Week</a></h3>
	<p>Startup Fashion Week is the first of its kind, representing the newly-developed intersection of fashion, business and technology. Founder and Managing Director Jodi Goodfellow created this initiative after establishing her own online business. Realizing the greater need for support in the fashion startup community, she hosted the informative workshop and networking event, “Fashion in the Digital World.” After doubled attendance at the second event, Goodfellow decided to focus on filling this ever-growing gap by creating Startup Fashion Week.</p>
