    <h3>What makes Brizi different from a drone with a camera?</h3>
    <hr>
	<p>Today's most advanced and high-end drones can stay afloat in the air for up to 15 minutes, Brizi's proprietary lightweight system runs for 3 hours before needing a quick battery swap. Drones are controlled by a single person where Brizi is building intelligent systems that can respond to an entire crowd's interactions, allowing the audience to direct its flight path. </p>

    <h3>What safety measures have you taken with Brizi?</h3>
    <hr>
	<p>We take safety very seriously and make our envelopes out of the same material as beachballs, which lets air seep out very slowly when punctured and lets impact upon human contact be barely noticeable. We ensure the usage of non-flammable helium and flexible propellors, flying at no more than 0.5kph.
